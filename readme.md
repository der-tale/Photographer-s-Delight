Photographer's Delight
======================

Photographer's Delight is (of now) a set of classes to build nice and fat free jQuery based image galleries. A sample theme is included to show all of PD's features: 

  * Image preloading for a fast and pleasant viewing experience
  * Image fading
  * Image switching via click, image indices (pagination-like)
  * Automatic fading (with an optional play/pause switch)
  * Image captions

PD is written in CoffeeScript, a compiled and minified version is included to get everything up and running quickly.

To view a demo have a look at my [photographic portfolio][portfolio] on my website or just pull the code and check out the samples.
